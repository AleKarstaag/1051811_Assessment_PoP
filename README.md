# Final Assessment for the Python for Programming Course
Candidate Number: 1051811

This is a repository containing a package in completion of a Python for programming course during my MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing.
More precisely I implemented a finite element method in order to solve the Helmholtz equation in arbitrary two dimensional square shaped domains with Homogeneous Dirichlet Boundary Condition. 
Open the 10518111_Principles_of_Programming.pdf file to get a quick guide on how the package works and how to use it.
